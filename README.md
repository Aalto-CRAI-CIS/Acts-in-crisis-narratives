# Acts-in-crisis-narratives
This project investigates how computational analysis of acts in crisis news comments can aid more in-depth analyses of public perspectives on crises, and support crisis response and mitigation.

## Act annotation scheme

The acts used in the annotation of our data and training of models are based on CMC and conversation analytic literature (e.g. Clark and Schaefer, 1989; Herring et al., 2005; Stivers, 2013). See Paakki and Ghorbanpour (2024) below for more details. Acts used include:  `["question", "challenge", "request", "statement", "appreciation", "denial", "apology", "acceptance"]`

## Analysis

An example of the time series analysis conducted in this work is provided as a notebook in this repository.
